                    Our Google Analytics product helps businesses and site owners analyze the traffic to their websites and apps. When used in conjunction with our
                    advertising services, such as those using the DoubleClick cookie, Google Analytics information is linked, by the Google Analytics customer or by
                    Google, using Google technology, with information about visits to multiple sites.

              	<li class="bg-similar">We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our
                    services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example, by saving your language preferences, we'll be
                    able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or
                    similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.

                </li>
              	<li>Device information  We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and
                   mobile network information including phone number). Google may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Google Account.

                </li>
              	<li>When you contact Google, we keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. We may use your email address to

                </li>
              	<li>Information we get from your use of our services. We collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you watch
                   a video on YouTube, visit a website that uses our advertising services, or view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:

                </li>
              	<li class="bg-different">There are many different ways you can use our services - to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new
                   content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Google Account, we can make those services even better - to show you more
                   relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want
                   you to be clear how we're using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.

                </li>
              	<li>How we use information we collect  We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to
                   develop new ones, and to protect Google and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content - like giving you more relevant
                   search results and ads.

                </li>
              	<li>Unique application numbers  Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example,
                   the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Google when you install or uninstall that service or when that service
                   periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.

                </li>
              	<li>Information we collect  We collect information to provide better services to all of our users - from figuring out basic stuff like which language you
                   speak, to more complex things like which ads you'll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might
                   like.

                </li>
              	<li>We collect information in the following ways:  Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Google
                   Account. When you do, we'll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card to store with your account.
                   If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Google Profile, which may include
                   your name and photo.

                </li>
              	<li class="bg-different">We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services - for example
                    to make it easier to share things with people you know. We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information
                    unless we have your opt-in consent.
