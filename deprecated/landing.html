                      Our Google Analytics product helps businesses and site owners analyze the traffic to their websites and apps. When used in conjunction with our
                      advertising services, such as those using the DoubleClick cookie, Google Analytics information is linked, by the Google Analytics customer or by
                      Google, using Google technology, with information about visits to multiple sites.

                      services. One of the products we use to do this on our own services is Google Analytics. For example, by saving your language preferences, we'll be
                      able to have our services appear in the language you prefer. When showing you tailored ads, we will not associate an identifier from cookies or
                      similar technologies with sensitive categories, such as those based on race, religion, sexual orientation or health.

                     content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Google Account, we can make those services even better - to show you more
                     relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want
                     you to be clear how we're using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.

                  </li>
                	<li>Unique application numbers  Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example,
                     the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Google when you install or uninstall that service or when that service
                     periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.

                  </li>
                	<li>Information we collect  We collect information to provide better services to all of our users - from figuring out basic stuff like which language you
                     speak, to more complex things like which ads you'll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might
                     like.

                  </li>
                	<li>We collect information in the following ways:  Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Google
                     Account. When you do, we'll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card to store with your account.
                     If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Google Profile, which may include
                     your name and photo.

                	<li class="bg-different">We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services - for example

                            •      Visit your Google Account History for settings that allow you to control the collection of personal information from Google services, such as
                                    Search, YouTube and Location History.
                            •      Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.
                            •      View and edit your preferences about the Google ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which categories might interest
                                    you, using Ads Settings. You can also opt out of certain Google advertising services here.
                            •       Adjust how the Profile associated with your Google Account appears to others.
                            •       Control who you share information with through your Google Account.
